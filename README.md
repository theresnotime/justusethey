# Just Use They
https://www.justusethey.com is *another* minisite on using the [gender-neutral singular they](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they).

## Thoughts?
I'm not good at words, and I'm *certainly* not an "authority" on this topic â€” if you have suggestions on wording, or any comments at all, please file an issue/pull request ðŸ’œ

## Development
This repo uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format the code â€” it's really opinionated, but it's a great way to keep the code consistent.

Please remember to run `npm run format` before committing, otherwise the CI will cry :-)

## Credits, etc.
